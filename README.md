project that allows to hide info on .png file extensions

### Implementation
* project was made with java and makes the least significant blue bit from the RGB on the image hide the info.
* the program can distinguish when an image has a message on it and when it doesen't.

### Compiling 

* users shall use 
```
javac grayscale.java 
```

### Executing

* users shall use
```
java grayscale
```

* then the program will ask you an image (.png ) **only requires the file name (filename)** 
* then the program will give you some space to type and write what you want to put

### Decripting

* users shall do the same steps with compiling and executing but this time on the OpenGrayScale **requires the file extension in the text field (filename.png)**
